# Getting Started: HPC Crash Course

Welcome to the Crash Course CafÃ©! â˜• Pull up a chair and let's get you productive on QUT Aqua without the usual learning curve headaches.

---

## Course Overview

### What This Course Covers

This isn't your typical academic introduction to high-performance computing. This is a practical, no-nonsense guide to getting real work done on QUT's Aqua system. We'll focus on the essential skills you need to submit jobs, avoid common mistakes, and not look like a complete newbie in your first week.

### Who This Is For

- **New to HPC/PBS**: You've heard scary stories about command lines and job schedulers
- **New to QUT Aqua**: You've used other HPC systems but Aqua has its own quirks
- **Impatient learners**: You want to be productive today, not after reading 200 pages of documentation

### Course Philosophy

#### Quick Wins Over Comprehensive Theory

We'll teach you the 20% of knowledge that handles 80% of your daily tasks. Deep theory can wait until you actually need it.

#### Practical Solutions Over Academic Explanations

Every concept comes with copy-paste ready examples and real-world context from QUT Aqua.

#### QUT Aqua-Specific Focus

Generic PBS tutorials are everywhere. This course is tailored specifically to QUT's configuration, quirks, and common issues.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this crash course, you'll be able to:

- **Submit your first PBS job** without breaking anything
- **Estimate walltime** without wildly over- or under-requesting
- **Choose appropriate resources** (cores, memory, queues)
- **Troubleshoot common failures** before panicking
- **Know when to dig deeper** into the specialized guides

### What You Need

- **Basic command line familiarity**: You can navigate directories and edit files
- **QUT account access**: You can SSH into Aqua
- **A specific task in mind**: Having real work to do makes learning stick

### What You DON'T Need

- Deep understanding of parallel computing
- Experience with other job schedulers
- Perfect knowledge of every PBS directive

### Course Structure

#### Time Commitment

- **Total time**: ~105 minutes across 7 focused lessons
- **Lesson format**: 15 minutes each for maximum retention
- **Immediate productivity**: You'll get your environment set up and run interactive tasks in Lesson 1
- **Follow-up learning**: Each lesson connects to detailed guides for when you need more

#### How This Connects to Other Guides

This crash course is your launching pad. When you hit specific challenges, you'll know exactly which detailed guide to consult:

- **Remote development issues** â†’ Cmd+Opt+Remote
- **Complex walltime estimation** â†’ The Scheduler's Gambit
- **Advanced PBS scripting** â†’ PBS Cookbook

#### Next Steps After Completion

1. **Practice with your real work** - Apply what you've learned immediately
2. **Bookmark the troubleshooting guides** - For when things inevitably go wrong
3. **Join the QUT HPC community** - Share your own discoveries and pain points
