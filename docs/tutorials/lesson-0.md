## 🏗️ Part 1: Understanding QUT Aqua Architecture (7 minutes)

!!! info "What Is a Compute Cluster?"
    A compute cluster is like a **digital apartment building** full of powerful computers, all connected and working together under one management system.

### Scale Comparison: Personal to Supercomputing

#### Your Laptop

This is what you're working with right now - a single computer with limited resources:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Your Laptop] --> B[1 CPU]
    B --> C[4-8 cores]
    B --> D[8-64 GB RAM]
    A --> F[1 GPU]
    A --> E[1 storage drive]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
```

#### A Compute Node

Now imagine scaling up to a single node in the HPC cluster - much more powerful hardware in one machine:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Compute Node] --> B[2-4 CPUs]
    B --> C[24-128 cores total]
    B --> D[128-512 GB RAM]
    A --> G[1-4 GPUs]
    A --> E[Local storage]
    A --> F[Network storage access]


    style A fill:#fff3e0
```

#### QUT Aqua: The Complete Infrastructure

Finally, here's how hundreds of these powerful nodes work together as a complete system:

```mermaid

        Client[Your Laptop]
        Internet[Internet/VPN]
    end

    subgraph "Management Layer"

```

!!! info "QUT Aqua Specifications"
    - **70+ compute nodes** with different capabilities
    - **10,000+ CPU cores** across the cluster
    - **100+ GPU cards** (H100, A100) for AI/ML workloads
    - **High-speed InfiniBand** interconnect for parallel jobs
    - **Petabyte-scale storage** accessible from all nodes

    For detailed hardware specifications, see [QUT eResearch Aqua Hardware Documentation](https://docs.eres.qut.edu.au/about-aqua#hardware)[^1].

### File Systems

!!! info "Complete Documentation"
    For detailed filesystem specifications, quotas, and usage guidelines, see [QUT eResearch Filesystem Documentation](https://docs.eres.qut.edu.au/hpc-filesystem#summary-of-important-filesystems-mounted-on-aqua)[^1].

Files on Aqua are stored in different locations depending on their purpose and access requirements:

**Home Directory (`/home/$USER` or `~`):**

- **Your personal workspace** - only you can access it
- **Lustre filesystem** - reliable storage with good performance
- **Regularly backed up** - safe for important files
- **Use for**: Scripts, configuration files, small personal data
- **Created automatically** when you first log in

**Scratch Storage (`/scratch`):**

- **High-performance temporary workspace** for active computations
- **Weka filesystem** - extremely fast I/O (17 million IOPS, 500GB/s)
- **Not backed up** - data can be lost!
- **Cleaned automatically** - files deleted if inactive after 30 days
- **Use for**: Large datasets during analysis, temporary job files
- **Create project folders**: `mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/project_name`

**Work Storage (`/work`):**

- **Shared project storage** for research groups
- **Lustre filesystem** - reliable and backed up
- **Request via eResearch ticket** - not automatically available
- **Use for**: Long-term research data, shared datasets

**Temporary Storage (`$TMPDIR`):**

- **Job-specific fast storage** - only available during job execution
- **Weka filesystem** - ultra-fast for temporary files
- **Automatically cleaned** when job finishes
- **Use for**: Intermediate calculations, temporary outputs

!!! tip "File system best practice: avoid millions of small files in `/home`"
    The Lustre-backed `/home/$USER` filesystem slows down when a single user accumulates millions of small files. QUT eResearch asks users to keep file counts in home reasonable, and to archive folders that aren't in active use[^1].

    **If a workflow generates many small files** (extracting large archives, compiling software with many intermediates, large dependency installs), prefer either of:

    - **Run it on `/scratch`** and copy the finished output back to `/home`:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/project_work
    cd /scratch/$USER/project_work
    # ... do the build / extract here ...
    cp -r <results> ~/                  # back to home when done
    ```

    - **Archive completed folders** with `tar` once you're finished with them:

    ```bash
    tar -cvf <foldername>.tar <foldername>
    rm -rf <foldername>
    ```

    !!! warning
        `/scratch` files are deleted after 30 days of inactivity, so move anything you want to keep into `/home` (or shared `/work`) before then.

    Reference: [QUT eResearch — Filesystem and data management](https://docs.eres.qut.edu.au/hpc-filesystem#summary-of-important-filesystems-mounted-on-aqua)[^1].

!!! tip "Storage Performance Comparison"
    | Filesystem | Speed | Backup | Use Case |
    |------------|-------|--------|----------|
    | **Home** | Good | ✅ Yes | Scripts, configs |
    | **Scratch** | Ultra-fast | ❌ No | Active analysis, many small files |
    | **Work** | Good | ✅ Yes | Project data |
    | **TMPDIR** | Ultra-fast | ❌ No | Job temporaries |

## 🧠 Part 2: What PBS Actually Does for You (8 minutes)

### The Problem PBS Solves

Imagine trying to organize shared use of a car among 500 people without any system. Chaos, right?

!!! info "Without Job Scheduling"
    ```mermaid
    graph TB
        A[500 Users] --> B[Physical Hardware]
        C[User 1: Needs all memory] --> B
        D[User 2: Needs all cores] --> B
        E[User 3: Long running job] --> B
        F[...498 more users] --> B

        B --> G[Complete chaos! 🔥]

        style G fill:#ffebee
    ```

### PBS: Your Digital Resource Manager

**PBS (Portable Batch System)** is like having a really smart building manager who handles all the resource allocation and scheduling automatically.

### How PBS Works?

Here's the basic flow of how PBS manages your job from submission to completion:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant PBS
    participant Cluster

    You->>PBS: "I need 4 cores for 2 hours"
    PBS->>PBS: Checks available resources
    PBS->>You: "Job queued, position #23"
    PBS->>Cluster: Allocates resources when available
    PBS->>You: "Job started on node aqua-01"
    Cluster->>PBS: Job completed
    PBS->>You: "Your results are ready!"
```

### Types of PBS Jobs You'll Use

There are three essential types of PBS jobs, each designed for different workflows:

#### Interactive Jobs

When you need to work directly on compute nodes in real-time, interactive jobs give you immediate access:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant PBS
    participant Node

    You->>PBS: qsub -I (request interactive session)
    PBS->>PBS: Find available resources
    PBS->>Node: Allocate compute node
    Node->>You: Direct terminal access
    You->>Node: Run commands interactively
    Node->>You: See results immediately
    You->>Node: exit (when done)
    Node->>PBS: Release resources
```

- **Real-time access** to compute nodes - like SSH into a powerful computer
- **Perfect for**: Testing code, debugging, exploring data interactively
- **Command**: `qsub -I -l walltime=02:00:00 -l select=1:ncpus=4:mem=8GB`
- **Use when**: You need to run commands and see results immediately

#### Batch Jobs

When you need to run longer tasks without staying connected, batch jobs are the solution:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant PBS
    participant Node
    participant Files

    You->>Files: Create script.pbs
    You->>PBS: qsub script.pbs
    PBS->>PBS: Queue job, wait for resources
    PBS->>Node: Allocate when available
    Node->>Files: Read and execute script
    Node->>Files: Write output files
    Node->>PBS: Job completed
    PBS->>You: Email notification (optional)
```

- **Submit and wait** - your script runs when resources become available
- **Perfect for**: Long-running analysis, production workflows, overnight jobs
- **Command**: `qsub my_script.pbs` (submit a script file)
- **Use when**: You have a defined workflow that can run unattended

#### Job Arrays

For processing multiple similar tasks efficiently, job arrays let you scale up your work:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant PBS
    participant Node1
    participant NodeN
    participant Files

    You->>Files: Create array_script.pbs
    You->>PBS: qsub -J 1-100 array_script.pbs
    PBS->>PBS: Create 100 individual jobs

    par Job 1
        PBS->>Node1: Run script with PBS_ARRAY_INDEX=1
        Node1->>Files: Write output files
    and Job N
        PBS->>NodeN: Run script with PBS_ARRAY_INDEX=N
        NodeN->>Files: Write output files
    end

    Node1->>PBS: Job 1 complete
    NodeN->>PBS: Job N complete
```

- **Many similar jobs** running the same script with different inputs
- **Perfect for**: Processing multiple files, parameter sweeps, Monte Carlo simulations
- **Command**: `qsub -J 1-100 array_script.pbs` (runs 100 copies)
- **Use when**: You need to repeat the same analysis on different datasets

**Common Resource Requests:**

- **Walltime**: `walltime=02:00:00` (how long your job will run)
- **Cores**: `ncpus=4` (number of CPU cores)
- **Memory**: `mem=8GB` (amount of RAM)
- **GPU**: `ngpus=1` (number of GPU cards for AI/ML work)
- **CPU Type**: `cpu_id=AMD-25-17` (AMD EPYC processors)
- **GPU Type**: `gpu_id=H100` or `gpu_id=A100` (specify GPU model)

### Why Job Scheduling Exists?

Without PBS, 500+ users would compete for the same hardware simultaneously - complete chaos!
