# Welcome to Walltime Chronicles

> A guide nobody asked for, but everyone eventually needs.

Welcome to **Walltime Chronicles** — a personal documentation project capturing all the weird, confusing, and occasionally infuriating challenges I have faced while using **QUT’s HPC systems** (powered by PBS).

If you have ever:

- Submitted a job that instantly failed for reasons only known to the cluster gods,
- Fought with `walltime` limits like you were disarming a bomb,
- Wondered why your script runs perfectly *except* when submitted through `qsub`,
- Or simply stared into the abyss of PBS logs...

Then this is the right place.

## What You’ll Find Here

- :thread: **Mystery Errors & How I Solved Them**  
  Real issues with real fixes (and real frustration).

- :brain: **Tips, Workarounds, and Gotchas**  
  Things that *should* have been in the official docs.

- :hammer_pick: **PBS Scripts & Snippets**  
  Copy-paste-friendly templates with helpful comments.

- :test_tube: **Experiments & Mistakes**  
  Because learning is messy.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official QUT guide. It is just my (occasionally ranty) collection of notes, meant to help others avoid the black holes I fell into. Use at your own risk — and sanity.

Happy queueing, and may your jobs always run on the first try.
