# Walltime Chronicles

> A guide nobody asked for, but everyone eventually needs.

My personal survival log of mysterious errors, queueing oddities, and PBS quirks encountered on QUT Aqua HPC system. This is where I document all the weird, confusing, and occasionally infuriating challenges I've faced while using QUT's HPC systems.

## What's Inside

- :thread: **Mystery Errors & Their Solutions**  
  Real issues with real fixes (and real frustration).

- :brain: **Tips, Workarounds, and Gotchas**  
  Things that *should* have been in the official docs.

- :hammer_and_wrench: **PBS Scripts & Snippets**  
  Copy-paste-friendly templates with helpful comments.

- :test_tube: **Experiments & Mistakes**  
  Because learning is messy.
